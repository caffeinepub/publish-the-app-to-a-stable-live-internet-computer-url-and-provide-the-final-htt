# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Publish the existing app to a stable Internet Computer (mainnet) HTTPS URL and record the final live link.

**Planned changes:**
- Perform a production (non-preview) deployment of the existing app to Internet Computer mainnet and capture the final stable HTTPS URL.
- Update `frontend/DEPLOYMENT.md` with complete, copy-pastable steps to deploy to IC mainnet and to retrieve/confirm the final live HTTPS URL, including note about SSL/certificate propagation delays.

**User-visible outcome:** Users can open the app via a stable HTTPS Internet Computer URL in a browser (without an “Unknown domain” error, allowing for normal certificate propagation delays).
